### “To know how much there is to know is the beginning of learning to live.” —Dorothy West

I am a Ph.D. student at the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas,
working with Prof. [Carlos Busso](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~busso/) in the
[Multimodal Signal Processing (MSP) Laboratory](https://ecs.utdallas.edu/research/researchlabs/msp-lab/). 
I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin - Platteville where I worked with 
Prof. [Hynek Boril](https://www.uwplatt.edu/profile/borilh) in the Pioneer Speech Signal Processing Laboratory (PSSPL).

Currently working on developing machine learning algorithms for studying expressive behavior. My research interests 
include machine learning, emotion recognition, human computer interaction (HCI) systems, multimodal time-series modelling, 
speech processing, and computer vision.
